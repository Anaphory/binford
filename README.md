Data, replications, critique, and extensions of Binford's “Constructing Frames of Reference” (2001)

Caution on using the data: Checking the first 18 numbers in Binford's table 4.09 revealed that about 4 of them were actually reflecting what the cited reference gives. Binford's description of how he adjusted some numbers in that table pertains to none of these.
