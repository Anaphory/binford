Data, replications, critique, and extensions of Binford's “Constructing Frames of Reference” (2001)

Caution on using the data: Checking the first 18 numbers in Binford's table 4.09 revealed that about 4 of them were actually reflecting what the cited reference gives. Binford's description of how he adjusted some numbers in that table pertains to none of these. Binford's sloppy use of data has been criticised elsewhere.
